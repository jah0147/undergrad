# Internship at Angeltrax Code

While I did write most of the code for this application, this software is the poperty of Angeltrax.

I, along with a fellow intern, wrote and designed this javaFX software for AngelTrax Mobile Video Surveillance Solutions.

This application is designed to take in .zip file data containing plots of Licence Plate images to edit and safe.
The plots are then saved and re-zipped with file names and coordinates for each file respectively. If no excel data
is already in the .zip, the application will create this.

This data is used to train Ai to recognize Licence PLates along with other various things. 

This Software has several Versions. I believe b0.9.1 is the latest verson.
When compiled and ran, these different version will have different functions than the final product. 
This may also include bugs.
