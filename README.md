# Auburn Undergrad
This is a repository that will contain many of my course work at Auburn University

This may also include personal projects made during undergrad.

Most files that are shown in this Repo are from Junior and Senior Year at Auburn.


Freshman and Softmore classes have far too many files for github to upload. These files are saved on cloud storage and can be viewed upon request at jacob.howard@auburn.edu. These files include Java1, Java2, Software Construction, and Embedded Systems.
